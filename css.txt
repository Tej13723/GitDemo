CSS - Cascading style sheets.

It is used to style a website/html pages.

why css? styling can be done with html but if one is working on a big proj a simple task like setting a font colour will need to the font tag to be addressed on every line. Whereas in css, it can be done without repeting the tags

types - inline, linked, embedded.

inline - applying the style to a particular line.

embedded - <style>
              p { font-family: ariel, impact, sans sarif;color: red}
           </style ------------- This is applied to where ever p is used.

linked - using a single css for multiple files
